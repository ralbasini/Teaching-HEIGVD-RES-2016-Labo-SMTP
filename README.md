RES - LAB 02 - HEIG-VD 
===================

Repository for the SMTP client lab.

----------
#Description Of The Project
-------------

###**Technologies used**

JAVA 8, MockMock Server, Netbeans 8.0.2

###**Descrption**
A simple SMTP client which goal is to send e-mails to a list of addresses. A mock SMTP server is used. The main purpose of this project is to implement a SMTP client.

###**Installation**
**Step 1**: Clone the repository into yours.
**Step 2**: Launch the "MockMock.jar". Instructions can be found in the section "Mock SMTP Server Installation"
**Step 3**: Move the files appconfig.properties, emails.txt, messages.txt to the repertory where MailRobot.jar is   located. Example: c:\test\MailRobot.jar -> must be placed into c:\test\
**Step 4**: Compile and  the "MailRobot.jar" using "java -jar MailRobot.jar" in your prompt.

###**Configuration**
> ***appconfig.properties*** is the file in which all the configuration propreties are stored. 
>
 - filed : smtpServerAddress --> localhost by default but it can be edited.
 - filed : smtpServerAddress --> localhost by default but it can be
   edited. 
 - filed : smtpServerPort   --> Cannot be edited since it is the   assigned port of the SMTP protocol. 
 - filed : numberOfGroups --> Depends on the number of e-mails you want to use. 
The composition of a group is "One sender and two receivers". So three e-mail addresses means  one group. For example, to be able to send e-mails to two groups, emails.txt must contain at least six e-mail adrresses.

> ***emails.txt*** is the file in which the list of e-mail addresses is stored.
> ***messages.txt*** is the file in which the textual content of the e-mails to send is stored. Attention, one message only is possible with our implementation.

###**Implementation**
 Please, have a look at the figure stored in the reperotry *figures *. the file diagram.png contains the class diagram of the project.
   ![class diagram](/figures/diagram.png)
 **Organizer.java**: Important class in which all the necessary information are collected from the different files. 
 Class functions: 
 -- readMessages() open the file *message.txt* in which the message to send is stored. 
 -- readEmails() open the *email.txt* file where the list of e-mail address is stored
 -- generateGroups() creates the wanted number of groups. The number of groups depends on the number of e-mail address and the field numberOfGroups of the configuration file *appconfig.properties*
 
**SmtpClient.java**: The SMTP client. This class can connect to a SMTP server and send messages. The protocol used in our implementation is the one recommended by RFC standards:

>Example:
telnet smtp.xxxx.xxxx/IP address 25 
Connected to smtp.xxxx.xxxx./IP address
220 smtp.xxxx.xxxx SMTP Ready
EHLO client
250-smtp.xxxx.xxxx
250-PIPELINING
250 8BITMIME       
MAIL FROM: <author@yyyy.yyyy>
250 Sender ok
RCPT TO: <dest@xxxx.xxxx>
250 Recipient ok.
DATA
354 Enter mail, end with "." 
Subject: Test
Corps du texte
.
250 Ok
QUIT
221 Closing connection
Connection closed by foreign host. 

**Person.java**: Representation of a person for whom we want to send an e-mail. Contains the e-mail address as a private attribut.
**Group.java**: A group of persons.
**Message.java**: The message we want to send.

###**Mock SMTP Server Installation**
 A jar file is included in root of the repo. The command to execute the program in any promp is "java -jar MockMock.jar -p 25", where -p is the port used by the server. Be carreful, you should always have the lastest java version installed on your system.
